level0:
  short: A project at level 0 on the maturity scale inconsistently tracks security-relevant issues
  long: Some security-relevant bugs, defects, spikes, stories, etc. for this project may be tracked and identified as
    security relevant, but it is not done consistently; and any means used to identify security issues does not enable
    them to be easily tracked.  Consistently tracking security-relevant issues in a way that enables tool users
    (including engineering and security specialists) to be able to quickly and easily find security-relevant issues may
    be useful (or necessary) for a variety of reasons.

taskDefinitions:
  bugTracking:
    title: Use issue management tool for tracking and specifically identifying security issues
    description: |
      Use the issue management tool to track issues that are security flaws or would improve security; label those
      security-relevant issues with the "security" label.

      Having a means to enable easy tracking and searching of security-relevant issues helps security specialists
      contributing to the project quickly find applicable work items.  This can also be a useful check that there are no
      known serious security issues prior to a release.

  definitionOfDone:
    title: Integrate security in issue acceptance criteria and the Definition of Done
    description: |
      Incorporate security plan components into the definition of done, and regularly capture specific security needs in
      the acceptance criteria for issue completion, particularly as maturity improves in various practices.

      For stories, this may include activities such as: peer review passed, static and dynamic analysis checks passed,
      and tests written.

      For features or work items with larger scope, this may include activities such as: threat modeling performed, and
      secure design principles adhered to.

      This helps teams maintain attained maturity levels in the application of practices, by including them in the team
      or organization's way of working.

  documentedProcess:
    title: Document use of issue management
    description:
      Document how issue management is used for managing security-related issues and flaws on the project, for example
      in a Confluence page describing a team or product way of working; or in the definition of done.
    questions:
      - text:
          Have you documented how issue management tools are used for managing security-related issues and flaws on the
          project?
