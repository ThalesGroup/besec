name: Vulnerability Assessment

notes: |
  Vulnerability assessment is the practice of reviewing and testing a product to discover security flaws. Penetration
  testing (aka pentesting) attempts to actively exploit weaknesses identified in a system or environment. While the two
  terms are often used interchangeably, they mean different things.

  A vulnerability assesment is typically carried out by an independent party to the team that created the product.

  Performing vulnerability assessments of our products uses expertise in attacking systems that may not be available
  within the company (or may not have been available internally in the timescales required) to identify security flaws
  in our products prior to release.

  The level and complexity of assessment - primarily scope and budget - are important variables to be decided for each
  assessment. Usually assessors should have full access to the target's source code, as this provides the most value
  from an assessment.

questions:
  - id: assessable
    text: Are the project deliverables reasonably able to undergo vulnerability assessment?
    na: false

condition: assessable

level0:
  short: A project at level 0 on the maturity scale hasn't considered performing a vulnerability assessment.
  long: The project may benefit from a vulnerability assessment given the scope of un-assessed changes in the product.

taskDefinitions:
  haveAssessment:
    title: Perform a vulnerability assessment
    description: |
      If a vulnerability assessment has never been performed, an assessment should be arranged.

      Review which areas of the product are worth performing a third party vulnerability assessment on. The review
      should involve a security expert and a technical lead in the product.

      <placeholder for details on how to arrange this in your organization - budgets, test houses, RFPs, etc>
    questions:
      - text: Has the product ever had a vulnerability assessment?
    level: 1

  newFindingsAddressed:
    title: Evaluate and address all findings
    description: Findings from a vulnerability assessment should be triaged, captured in the issue tracking system, and
      prioritised and fixed appropriately.

      Valid findings from a vulnerability assessment will typically be high priority issues, as they represent either
      exploitable vulnerabilities or other security risks. For issues that apply to released products, the usual
      vulnerability management process should be used to determine if a customer security advisory is required.
    questions:
      - text:
          Are findings from vulnerability assessments promptly triaged, and fixed in a timely manner given their
          priority as security issues?
        id: findingsTriaged
      - text:
          Are findings that represent vulnerabilities in released products being handled according to the vulnerability
          management process?

  assessRiskyChanges:
    title: Perform vulnerability assessments after risky changes
    description: |
      Risky, security-relevant changes increase the possibility that vulnerabilities could be introduced in a project.
      Project teams should adopt the practice of having vulnerability assessments performed after potentially high risk
      changes or additions.

      The scheduling of vulnerability assessments should still be done pragmatically. If a number of high risk changes
      or additions are being made prior to a product release, for instance, then it doesn't necessarily make sense to
      have a vulnerability assessment performed after each change is complete. Having the vulnerability assessment done
      after the changes and/or additions are all completed (but before a product release, if possible) makes more sense
      from a business and efficiency standpoint.
    questions:
      - text:
          Does the project team routinely have third party vulnerability assessments done on the project when high risk
          changes have been made?
    level: 2

  periodicAssessments:
    title: Arrange periodic assessments (at least annually)
    description: |
      Having regular assessments helps to limit the amount of time that passes between releases and
      assessments, and increases the likelihood that issues with new or updated features undergo testing.

      For projects that release updates frequently, it is likely that a shorter time frame than annually would be
      beneficial. However, if additions of or changes to high-risk features happens infrequently, then annually may be
      sufficient. These factors should be taken into consideration as part of the assessment planning process.

      Similarly, favor assessment quality over frequency if budget constraints limit what is possible. frequently
      checking for the same basic issues will deliver less value than occasionally doing a thorough assessment.
    questions:
      - text: Does the project team organize regular, periodic vulnerability assessments (performed at least annually)?
    level: 3

  incorporateTests:
    title: Incorporate tests from vulnerability assessments into testing
    description: |
      When a vulnerability assessment is performed, the assessers may use testing tools or tests that would be useful
      to incorporate into the project's test suite. When possible and useful, those tests should be regularly used to
      test the project.
    questions:
      - text: Are tests from vulnerability assessments routinely incorporated into automated testing?
    level: 4

  documentedProcess:
    title: Document process
    description:
      Capture how vulnerability assessments are done on the project, including frequency and cadence; the test houses
      that have been used or that can be used; the features tested; the results collected; etc.
    questions:
      - text: Have you captured how vulnerability assessments are done on the project?
    level: 4

  auditProcess:
    title: Audit use of vulnerability assessments
    description: Routinely audit the use of vulnerability assessments to verify execution and value meet expectations.
    questions:
      - text:
          Does the project team routinely audit its use of vulnerability asessments meet expectations, both of reported
          maturity level, as well as expected value?
