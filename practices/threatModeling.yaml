level0:
  short:
    A project at level 0 on the maturity scale does not undergo threat modeling of features (high risk or otherwise), or
    threats identified by threat modeling are not addressed.
  long:
    Threat modeling of new features (high risk or otherwise) may occur, but the threat modeling does not happen with
    regularity; and the identified threats may not always be addressed.

taskDefinitions:
  analyzeHighRiskFeatures:
    title: Perform threat modeling for new high risk features
    description: |
      Perform threat modeling for high risk features being added, and ensure all identified threats are appropriately
      addressed. <placeholder for a link to your organization's guidance>

      Threat modeling is a structural analysis of the security of a feature, which enables identification, enumeration,
      prioritization, and mitigation of the potential threats in the feature.

      This process intends to improve the quality of the design of the feature and reduce the number of potential
      vulnerabilities.
    questions:
      - text: Are threat models routinely generated and used for high risk features?
    level: 1

  generateTestCases:
    title: Generate test cases
    description: |
      Generate test cases based on threat model and incorporate the test cases into testing.

      Generating test cases based on feature threat models ensures that implemented mitigations for identified threats
      are in place and effective.
    questions:
      - text:
          Are threat models used as an input to the testing process, in order to generate and test threats based on the
          project's threat model(s)?
    level: 2

  analyzeNewFeatures:
    title: Routine threat modelling for all features
    description: Perform threat modeling for all new features.
    questions:
      - text:
          Are threat models required to be generated for all new features, and updated for features for which threat
          models already exist when changes are made to those features?
    level: 3

  toolUsage:
    title: Use a threat modeling tool
    description:
      Perform threat modeling using an appropriate tool (MS Threat Modeling tool, OWASP Threat Dragon, SeaSponge,
      ThreatModeler, etc.)
    questions:
      - text: Is a threat modeling tool used?
    level: 3

  documentProcess:
    title: Document threat modeling process
    description:
      Capture how threat modeling is applied on the project, for example in the definition of done or in a Confluence
      page describing a team or product way of working.
    questions:
      - text:
          Have you captured how threat modeling is applied on the project? For example in the definition of done, or in
          a Confluence page describing a team or product way of working?
    level: 4

  enableReuse:
    title: Enable recording and reuse of threats and controls
    description:
      Document information about threats and controls so as to make the information available for use by other
      projects.  Projects should leverage information about existing threats that have been identified and mitigated.
    questions:
      - text:
          Are existing threats and controls being reused from other features; and recorded in a way that encourages
          reuse for other features?
    level: 4

  auditProcess:
    title: Audit application of threat modeling
    description: Routinely audit the application of the threat modeling practice to verify execution meets expectations.
    questions:
      - text:
          Does the project development team routinely audit its applicaton of threat modeling to ensure it meets
          expectations of reported maturity level?
