                      Lots of issues are security issues. TeS JIRA does have a Security attribute (not label). New JIRA
                      has a security label but it isn't being used.

                      Some elements are in the DoD - peer review, unit testing. Others are not. Each team owns its own
                      DoD. Answer here is only for the core team - don't know about other teams.

                      Review Board might be useful here - integrates with JIRA. Gitlab protected branches have been used
                      on some projects too.

                      it's kind of moot.
