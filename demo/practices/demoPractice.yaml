name: Demo Static Analysis

notes: |
  This practice is used to demonstrate multiple practice versions.

level0:
  short:
    A project at level 0 on the maturity scale has a minimal or inconsistent amount of static analysis and issue triage
    performed, or does not analyze all code.
  long: Some code may undergo static analysis, and some effort may go into triaging and managing output, but these
    activities are not performed consistently or reliably.

tasks: [useTools, triageNew, demo]
taskDefinitions:
  # in priority order, with maturity questions embedded
  useTools:
    title: Routinely use static analysis
    description: |
      Deploy capability to routinely use applicable static analysis tools.

      Perform static analysis on all of the code that makes up the project, using at least a subset of the recommended
      configuration.
    questions:
      - text:
          Are one or more static analysis tools routinely used to scan all of the code in the project, using at least a
          subset of the recommended configuration?
    level: 1

  demo:
    title: A task that doesn't appear in subsequent versions
    description: A task that will disappear.
    questions:
      - text: Dummy
    level: 2

  triageNew:
    title: Triage all issues in new code
    description: |
      Triage and manage all identified issues in new code.

      This description is a little lacking - the delta enhances it
    questions:
      - text: Are all static analysis issues in code (other than legacy code) routinely identified and triaged?
    level: 4
