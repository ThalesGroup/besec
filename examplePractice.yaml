# A practice is specified in YAML, see https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ansible/ansible_yaml_basics.htm for an introduction covering the syntax we use
# Use two spaces for indentation (note: tabs won't work)

# The authoritative definition of the practice file format is in the practices/schema.json file.
# You can configure many text editors to provide as-you-type linting and tooltips by pointing it at the schema.

id: examplePractice
name: A template / example practice
page: https://confluence.example.com/display/SEC/Example # Optional URL to a page with extra information

# text in the notes field can include markdown
# multi paragraph content should be formatted as "notes: |", with the content beginning on the line after notes, indented
# including the "|" after "notes:" and starting the text indented after the next line is acceptable formatting even for single paragraph content.
# see the "description:" field below for an example formatting
notes: Optional notes about this practice, for example to explain any terminology used in the questions.

# optional - a list of qualifying questions, that determine whether this practice applies at all to the project
# do not include markdown in questions
questions:
  - text: How much do you care about security?
    # put an ID an all questions in this section, so that we can reference them later
    # references are scoped by the practice name, so don't worry about global uniqueness
    id: care
    # can't answer with N/A. If this isn't specified, then users can always answer N/A
    na: false
  - text: Is this a make it day project?
    id: makeItDay
    na: false
    # if you don't specify a list of answers to a question, then it is Yes/No by default

# If your practice has qualifying questions, then it will also need a condition explaining how to interpret the answers to those questions.
# If the practice always applies, then don't specify this
# The condition is an expression written in the language defined here: https://github.com/Knetic/govaluate
condition: (care == 'a little' || care == 'a lot') && !makeitday

level0: # optional, a description of a project that doesn't meet level 1 of the practice
  # short is a brief explanation of the characteristics of a project that doesn't meet Level 1
  # this text can include markdown
  short: This project is not very secure
  # long is an optional fuller explanation
  # this text can include markdown
  # a multi-paragraph "long:" should follow the formatting indicated above for the "notes:" field
  long: This project should be purged from our repositories post-haste.

# The tasks, defined below, that make up the practice
# The order matters - what is likely to be a more important task should come before a less important task
tasks: [beSecure, anotherTask]

# The core of the practice - the things teams need to do
taskDefinitions:
  beSecure:
    title: Be secure!
    # Text in the description field can include markdown
    # If you have a long bit of text, or need to embed newlines in an entry, you can use this "|" syntax.
    description: |
      You should be as secure as you can whilst working on this project.

      Refer to the [security section in the practice](page) for guidance on how to be *reasonably* **secure**.

      Also, for example:

      * Do this to be secure
      * Or try doing this
    # These questions should be yes/no to determine whether or not the team already does this task, and so it wouldn't be a change for them to do it.
    # In other words, if the team answer yes to all of these questions, we can reasonably expect them to do this task without much effort.
    # do not include markdown in questions
    questions:
      - text: Are you normally quite secure?
      # Even though there's only one question in this example, the format is still a list of questions
      # If you don't specify an ID for a question, it implicitly has the same ID as the task
      # If a task has multiple questions, they must each have explicit IDs
    level: 1

  anotherTask:
    title: Be super secure!
    description: You know the drill. Secure all the things.
    questions:
      - text: Have you secured everything?
    level: 4
