older versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please email us as described here:

## Security Update policy

Vulnerabilities will be communicated via GitHub Advisories and a description of
the issue will be included in the release notes.

## Security related configuration

TODO Settings users should consider that would impact the security posture of
deploying this project, such as HTTPS, authorization and many others.

## Known security gaps & future enhancements

There is no authorization policy: all users can perform all actions. If you need
to limit which users can modify particular projects, PRs are welcome! Note that
all admin tasks are via the CLI - we do not intend to implement admin
functionality in the web app.
